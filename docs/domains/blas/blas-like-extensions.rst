BLAS-like Extensions
====================


.. container::


   oneAPI Math Kernel Library DPC++ provides additional routines to
   extend the functionality of the BLAS routines. These include routines
   to compute many independent matrix-matrix products.

   The following table lists the BLAS-like Extensions with their descriptions.
