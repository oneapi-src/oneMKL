getrf_batch (Buffer Version)
----------------------------

.. rubric:: Description

The buffer version of ``getrf_batch`` supports only the strided API. 

**Strided API**

The routine computes the LU factorizations of general :math:`m \times n` matrices :math:`A_i` as :math:`A_i = P_iL_iU_i`, where :math:`P_i` is a permutation matrix, :math:`L_i` is lower triangular with unit diagonal elements (lower trapezoidal if :math:`m > n`) and :math:`U_i` is upper triangular (upper trapezoidal if :math:`m < n`). The routine uses partial pivoting, with row interchanges.

.. rubric:: Syntax

.. code-block:: cpp

    namespace oneapi::mkl::lapack {
      void getrf_batch(cl::sycl::queue &queue, std::int64_t m, std::int64_t n, cl::sycl::buffer<T> &a, std::int64_t lda, std::int64_t stride_a, cl::sycl::buffer<std::int64_t> &ipiv, std::int64_t stride_ipiv, std::int64_t batch_size, cl::sycl::buffer<T> &scratchpad, std::int64_t scratchpad_size)
    }

.. container:: section

   .. rubric:: Input Parameters

queue
  Device queue where calculations will be performed.

m
  Number of rows in matrices :math:`A_i` (:math:`0 \le m`).

n
  Number of columns in matrices :math:`A_i` (:math:`0 \le n`).

a
  Array holding input matrices :math:`A_i`.

lda
  Leading dimension of matrices :math:`A_i`.

stride_a
  Stride between the beginnings of matrices :math:`A_i` inside the batch array ``a``.

stride_ipiv
  Stride between the beginnings of arrays :math:`ipiv_i` inside the array ``ipiv``.

batch_size
  Number of problems in a batch.

scratchpad
  Scratchpad memory to be used by routine for storing intermediate results.

scratchpad_size
  Size of scratchpad memory as a number of floating point elements of type ``T``. Size should not be less than the value returned by the Strided API of the :ref:`onemkl_lapack_getrf_batch_scratchpad_size` function.

.. container:: section

   .. rubric:: Output Parameters

a
  :math:`L_i` and :math:`U_i`. The unit diagonal elements of :math:`L_i` are not stored.

ipiv
  Array containing batch of the pivot indices :math:`\text{ipiv}_i` each of size at least :math:`\max(1,\min(m,n))`; for :math:`1 \le k \le \min(m,n)`, where row :math:`k` of :math:`A_i` was interchanged with row :math:`\text{ipiv}_i(k)`.

.. container:: section

  .. rubric:: Throws

This routine shall throw the following exceptions if the associated condition is detected. An implementation may throw additional implementation-specific exception(s) in case of error conditions not covered here.

:ref:`oneapi::mkl::lapack::batch_error<onemkl_lapack_exception_batch_error>`

:ref:`oneapi::mkl::unimplemented<onemkl_exception_unimplemented>`

:ref:`oneapi::mkl::unsupported_device<onemkl_exception_unsupported_device>`

:ref:`oneapi::mkl::lapack::invalid_argument<onemkl_lapack_exception_invalid_argument>`
 
   The ``info`` code of the problem can be obtained by `info()` method of exception object:

    If ``info = -n``, the :math:`n`-th parameter had an illegal value.

    If ``info`` equals to value passed as scratchpad size, and `detail()` returns non zero, then passed scratchpad is of insufficient size, and required size should be not less then value returned by `detail()` method of exception object.

    If ``info`` is not zero and `detail()` returns zero, then there were some errors for some of the problems in the supplied batch and ``info`` code contains the number of failed calculations in a batch.

    If ``info`` is positive, then the factorization has been completed, but some of :math:`U_i` are exactly singular. Division by 0 will occur if you use the factor :math:`U_i` for solving a system of linear equations.

    The indices of such matrices in the batch can be obtained with `ids()` method of the exception object. The indices of first zero diagonal elements in these :math:`U_i` matrices can be obtained by `exceptions()` method of exception object.

getrf_batch (USM Version)
-------------------------

.. rubric:: Description

The USM version of ``getrf_batch`` supports the group API and strided API. 

**Group API**

The routine computes the batch of LU factorizations of general :math:`m \times n` matrices :math:`A_i` (:math:`i \in \{1...batch\_size\}`) as :math:`A_i = P_iL_iU_i`, where :math:`P_i` is a permutation matrix, :math:`L_i` is lower triangular with unit diagonal elements (lower trapezoidal if :math:`m > n`) and :math:`U_i` is upper triangular (upper trapezoidal if :math:`m < n`). The routine uses partial pivoting, with row interchanges. Total number of problems to solve, ``batch_size``, is a sum of sizes of all of the groups of parameters as provided by ``group_sizes`` array.
