potrs_batch (Buffer Version)
----------------------------

.. container:: section

  .. rubric:: Description

The buffer version of ``potrs_batch`` supports only the strided API. 
   
**Strided API**

 | The routine solves for :math:`X_i` the systems of linear equations :math:`A_iX_i = B_i` with a symmetric positive-definite or, for complex data, Hermitian positive-definite matrices :math:`A_i`, given the Cholesky factorization of :math:`A_i`, :math:`i \in \{1...batch\_size\}`:
 | :math:`A_i = U_i^TU_i` for real data, :math:`A_i = U_i^HU_i` for complex data if ``uplo = mkl::uplo::upper``,
 | :math:`A_i = L_iL_i^T` for real data, :math:`A_i = L_iL_i^H` for complex data if ``uplo = mkl::uplo::lower``,
 | where :math:`L_i` is a lower triangular matrix and :math:`U_i` is upper triangular.
 | The systems are solved with multiple right-hand sides stored in the columns of the matrices :math:`B_i`.
 | Before calling this routine, matrices :math:`A_i` should be factorized by call to the Strided API of the :ref:`onemkl_lapack_potrf_batch_buffer` function.

 | If ``uplo = mkl::uplo::lower``, the upper triangle :math:`L_i` of :math:`A_i` is stored, where :math:`A_i = L_iL_i^T` for real data, :math:`A_i = L_iL_i^H` for complex data.

scratchpad_size
  Size of scratchpad memory as a number of floating point elements of type ``T``. Size should not be less then the value returned by the Strided API of the :ref:`onemkl_lapack_potrs_batch_scratchpad_size` function.

.. container:: section

  .. rubric:: Output Parameters

b
  Solution matrices :math:`X_i`.

.. container:: section

  .. rubric:: Throws

This routine shall throw the following exceptions if the associated condition is detected. An implementation may throw additional implementation-specific exception(s) in case of error conditions not covered here.

:ref:`oneapi::mkl::lapack::batch_error<onemkl_lapack_exception_batch_error>`

:ref:`oneapi::mkl::unimplemented<onemkl_exception_unimplemented>`

:ref:`oneapi::mkl::unsupported_device<onemkl_exception_unsupported_device>`

:ref:`oneapi::mkl::lapack::invalid_argument<onemkl_lapack_exception_invalid_argument>`

   The ``info`` code of the problem can be obtained by `info()` method of exception object:

   If ``info = -n``, the :math:`n`-th parameter had an illegal value.

   If ``info`` equals to value passed as scratchpad size, and `detail()` returns non zero, then passed scratchpad is of insufficient size, and required size should be not less then value returned by `detail()` method of exception object.

   If ``info`` is not zero and `detail()` returns zero, then there were some errors for some of the problems in the supplied batch and ``info`` code contains the number of failed calculations in a batch.
   
   If ``info`` is zero, then for some of the matrices diagonal element of the Cholesky factor is zero, and the solve could not be completed. The indices of such matrices in the batch can be obtained with `ids()` method of the exception object. The indices of first zero diagonal elements in these matrices can be obtained by `exceptions()` method of exception object.
