=====

Reduces a general matrix to bidiagonal form.

.. container:: section

    .. rubric:: Description

``gebrd`` supports the following precisions.

     .. list-table:: 
        :header-rows: 1

        * -  T 
        * -  ``float`` 
        * -  ``double`` 
        * -  ``std::complex<float>`` 
        * -  ``std::complex<double>`` 

The routine reduces a general :math:`m \times n` matrix :math:`A` to a 
bidiagonal matrix :math:`B` by an orthogonal (unitary) transformation.


If :math:`m \ge n`, the reduction is given by :math:`A=QBP^H=\begin{pmatrix}B_1\\0\end{pmatrix}P^H=Q_1B_1P_H`

where :math:`B_{1}` is an :math:`n \times n` upper diagonal matrix,
:math:`Q` and :math:`P` are orthogonal or, for a complex :math:`A`, unitary
matrices; :math:`Q_{1}` consists of the first :math:`n` columns of
:math:`Q`.

If :math:`m < n`, the reduction is given by

:math:`A = QBP^H = Q\begin{pmatrix}B_1\\0\end{pmatrix}P^H = Q_1B_1P_1^H`,

where :math:`B_{1}` is an :math:`m \times m` lower diagonal matrix,
:math:`Q` and :math:`P` are orthogonal or, for a complex :math:`A`, unitary
matrices; :math:`P_{1}` consists of the first :math:`m` columns of
:math:`P`.

The routine does not form the matrices :math:`Q` and :math:`P` explicitly,
but represents them as products of elementary reflectors. Routines
are provided to work with the matrices :math:`Q` and :math:`P` in this
representation:

If the matrix :math:`A` is real,

-  to compute :math:`Q` and :math:`P` explicitly, call
   :ref:`onemkl_lapack_orgbr`.

If the matrix :math:`A` is complex,

-  to compute :math:`Q` and :math:`P` explicitly, call
   :ref:`onemkl_lapack_ungbr`

    }

  .. rubric:: Input Parameters

queue
   The queue where the routine should be executed.

m
   The number of rows in the matrix :math:`A` (:math:`0 \le m`).

n
   The number of columns in the matrix :math:`A` (:math:`0 \le n`).

a
   The buffer :math:`a`, size (``lda,*``). The buffer ``a`` contains the
   matrix :math:`A`. The second dimension of ``a`` must be at least
   :math:`\max(1, m)`.

lda
   The leading dimension of :math:`a`.

scratchpad_size
   Size of scratchpad memory as a number of floating point elements of type ``T``.
   Size should not be less than the value returned by :ref:`onemkl_lapack_gebrd_scratchpad_size` function.

.. container:: section

    .. rubric:: Output Parameters

a
   If :math:`m \ge n`, the diagonal and first super-diagonal of a are
   overwritten by the upper bidiagonal matrix :math:`B`. The elements
   below the diagonal, with the buffer tauq, represent the orthogonal
   matrix :math:`Q` as a product of elementary reflectors, and the
   elements above the first superdiagonal, with the buffer ``taup``,
   represent the orthogonal matrix :math:`P` as a product of elementary
   reflectors.

   If :math:`m<n`, the diagonal and first sub-diagonal of a are
   overwritten by the lower bidiagonal matrix :math:`B`. The elements
   below the first subdiagonal, with the buffer tauq, represent the
   orthogonal matrix :math:`Q` as a product of elementary reflectors, and
   the elements above the diagonal, with the buffer ``taup``, represent
   the orthogonal matrix :math:`P` as a product of elementary reflectors.

d
   Buffer, size at least :math:`\max(1, \min(m,n))`. Contains the diagonal
   elements of :math:`B`.

e
   Buffer, size at least :math:`\max(1, \min(m,n) - 1)`. Contains the
   off-diagonal elements of :math:`B`.

tauq
   Buffer, size at least :math:`\max(1, \min(m, n))`. The scalar factors of
   the elementary reflectors which represent the orthogonal or
   unitary matrix :math:`Q`.

taup
   Buffer, size at least :math:`\max(1, \min(m, n))`. The scalar factors of
   the elementary reflectors which represent the orthogonal or
   unitary matrix :math:`P`.

scratchpad
   Buffer holding scratchpad memory to be used by routine for storing intermediate results.

    .. rubric:: Throws

This routine shall throw the following exceptions if the associated condition is detected. An implementation may throw additional implementation-specific exception(s) in case of error conditions not covered here.

:ref:`oneapi::mkl::host_bad_alloc<onemkl_exception_host_bad_alloc>`

:ref:`oneapi::mkl::device_bad_alloc<onemkl_exception_device_bad_alloc>`

:ref:`oneapi::mkl::unimplemented<onemkl_exception_unimplemented>`

:ref:`oneapi::mkl::unsupported_device<onemkl_exception_unsupported_device>`

:ref:`oneapi::mkl::lapack::invalid_argument<onemkl_lapack_exception_invalid_argument>`

:ref:`oneapi::mkl::lapack::computation_error<onemkl_lapack_exception_computation_error>`

   Exception is thrown in case of problems during calculations. The ``info`` code of the problem can be obtained by `info()` method of exception object:

   If ``info=-i``, the ``i``-th parameter had an illegal value.

   If ``info`` equals to value passed as scratchpad size, and `detail()` returns non zero, then passed scratchpad is of insufficient size, and required size should not be less than value return by `detail()` method of exception object.
