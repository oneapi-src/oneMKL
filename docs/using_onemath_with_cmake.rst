Using oneMath in your project with CMake
========================================

The CMake build tool can help you use oneMath in your own project. Instead of
manually linking and including directories, you can use the CMake targets
exported by the oneMath project. You can use oneMath in one of two forms, with
the target names depending on the approach taken: 

* you can use a previously installed copy, either from a binary distribution or
  built from source. This can be imported using CMake's ``find_package``
  command. See the section `using_from_installed_binary`_.
* or you can have CMake automatically download and build oneMath as part of the
  build process using CMake's FetchContent_ functionality.
  See the section `using_with_fetchcontent`_.


.. _using_from_installed_binary:

Using an installed oneMath
##########################

If oneMath has been previously installed, either by building from source or as a
distributed binary, they can be consumed using CMake using
``find_package(oneMath REQUIRED)``. The compiler used for the target library or
application should match that used to build oneMath.

For example:

.. code-block:: cmake

    find_package(oneMath REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(myTarget PRIVATE MKL::onemath)

Different targets can be used depending on the requirements of oneMath. 
To link against the entire library, the ``MKL::onemath`` target should be used.
For specific domains, ``MKL::onemath_<domain>`` should be used.
And for specific backends, ``MKL::onemath_<domain>_<backend>`` should be used.

When using a binary, it may be useful to know the backends that were enabled
during the build. To check for the existence of backends, CMake's ``if(TARGET
<target>)`` construct can be used. For example, with the ``cufft`` backend:

.. code-block:: cmake

    if(TARGET MKL::onemath_dft_cufft)
        target_link_libraries(myTarget PRIVATE MKL::onemath_dft_cufft)
    else()
        message(FATAL_ERROR "oneMath was not built with CuFFT backend")
    endif()

.. _using_with_fetchcontent:

Using CMake's FetchContent
##########################


The FetchContent_ functionality of CMake can be used to download, build and
install oneMath as part of the build.

For example:

.. code-block:: cmake

    include(FetchContent)
    set(BUILD_FUNCTIONAL_TESTS False)
    set(BUILD_EXAMPLES False)
    set(ENABLE_<BACKEND_NAME>_BACKEND True)
    FetchContent_Declare(
            onemath_library
            GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneMath.git
            GIT_TAG develop
    )
    FetchContent_MakeAvailable(onemath_library)

    target_link_libraries(myTarget PRIVATE onemath)

The build parameters should be appropriately set before
``FetchContent_Declare``. See :ref:`building_the_project_with_dpcpp` or
:ref:`building_the_project_with_adaptivecpp`.

To link against the main library with run-time dispatching, use the target
``onemath``. To link against particular domains, use the target
``onemath_<domain>``. For example, ``onemath_blas`` or ``onemath_dft``. To link
against particular backends (as required for static dispatch of oneAPI calls to
a particular backend), use the target ``onemath_<domain>_<backend>``. For
example, ``onemath_dft_cufft``.
