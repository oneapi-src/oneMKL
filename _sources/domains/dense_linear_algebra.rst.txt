Dense Linear Algebra
---------------------

This section contains information about dense linear algebra routines:

:ref:`matrix-storage` provides information about dense matrix and vector storage formats that are used by oneMKL :ref:`onemkl_blas` and :ref:`onemkl_lapack`.

:ref:`onemkl_blas` provides vector, matrix-vector, and matrix-matrix routines for dense matrices and vector operations.

:ref:`onemkl_lapack` provides more complex dense linear algebra routines, e.g., matrix factorization, solving dense systems of linear equations, least square problems, eigenvalue and singular value problems, and performing a number of related computational tasks.
