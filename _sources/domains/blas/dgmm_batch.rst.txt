multiple diagonal matrix-matrix product operations in a single call.
   
``dgmm_batch`` supports the following precisions.

   .. list-table:: 
      :header-rows: 1

      * -  T 
      * -  ``float`` 
      * -  ``double`` 
      * -  ``std::complex<float>`` 
      * -  ``std::complex<double>`` 

.. _onemkl_blas_dgmm_batch_buffer:

dgmm_batch (Buffer Version)
---------------------------

.. rubric:: Description

The buffer version of ``dgmm_batch`` supports only the strided API. 

The strided API operation is defined as:
::

   for i = 0 … batch_size – 1
       A and C are matrices at offset i * stridea in a, i * stridec in c.
       X is a vector at offset i * stridex in x
       C := diag(X) * A or  C = A * diag(X)
   end for

where:

``A`` is a matrix,

``X`` is a diagonal matrix stored as a vector

The ``a`` and ``x`` buffers contain all the input matrices. The stride 
between matrices is given by the stride parameter. The total number
of matrices in ``a`` and ``x`` buffers is given by the ``batch_size`` parameter.

The group API operation is defined as:
::

   idx = 0
   for i = 0 … group_count – 1
       for j = 0 … group_size – 1
           a and c are matrices of size mxn at position idx in a_array and c_array

           else
               c := a * diag(x)
           idx := idx + 1
       end for
   end for

The strided API operation is defined as
::

   for i = 0 … batch_size – 1
       A and C are matrices at offset i * stridea in a, i * stridec in c.
       X is a vector at offset i * stridex in x
       C := diag(X) * A or  C = A * diag(X)
   end for

where:

``A`` is a matrix,

``X`` is a diagonal matrix stored as a vector

The ``a`` and ``x`` buffers contain all the input matrices. The stride 
between matrices is given by the stride parameter. The total number
of matrices in ``a`` and ``x`` buffers is given by the ``batch_size`` parameter.
 
For group API, ``a`` and ``x`` arrays contain the pointers for all the input matrices. 
The total number of matrices in ``a`` and ``x`` are given by: 

.. math::

      total\_batch\_count = \sum_{i=0}^{group\_count-1}group\_size[i]    
 
For strided API, ``a`` and ``x`` arrays contain all the input matrices. The total number of matrices 
in ``a`` and ``x`` are given by the ``batch_size`` parameter.
