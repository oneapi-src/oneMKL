LAPACK Routines
+++++++++++++++

oneMKL provides a DPC++ interface to select routines from the Linear Algebra PACKage (LAPACK), as well as several LAPACK-like extension routines.

      Different arrays used as parameters to oneMKL LAPACK routines must
      not overlap.

      LAPACK routines assume that input matrices do not contain IEEE 754
      special values such as INF or NaN values. Using these special
      values may cause LAPACK to return unexpected results or become
      unstable.
