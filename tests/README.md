# oneMKL Interfaces Testing

## Overview
Inside the `unit_tests` directory, there are domain-level directories which contain domain-specific tests, usually per function or per configuration.

See [Building and Running Tests](https://oneapi-src.github.io/oneMKL/building_and_running_tests.html) documentation for more information about how to build and run the tests.

[GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) is used as the unit-testing framework.
